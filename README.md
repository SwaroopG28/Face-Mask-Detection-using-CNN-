# Face Mask Detection using CNN

## Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect whether individuals in images are wearing face masks. Using a dataset of labeled images, the model was trained to classify images into two categories: with mask and without mask. The CNN architecture, built using Keras, processes the image input to identify the presence of a mask with high accuracy.

The project applies image processing and deep learning techniques to support health and safety compliance by detecting mask usage in real-time, suitable for integration with camera surveillance systems.
